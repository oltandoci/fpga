#1. Install python on Linux/Windows

Go to:
https://www.python.org/downloads/
(Also on Linux you can install it directly with "sudo apt install python3.5" for ex.)
We need the module matplotlib that you can install easily with pip install matplotlib

#2. Install needed packages on Linux only

sudo apt install zlibc zlib1g zlib-gst zlib1g-dev

#3. Install gtkwave

Linux:
sudo apt install gtkwave

Windows:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2GyAIYwZbw
Or, directly from: https://sourceforge.net/projects/gtkwave/
Make sure to add bin folder of gtkwave in the user path

#4. Install ghdl on Linux/Windows

Go to:
https://github.com/ghdl/ghdl/releases/tag/nightly
and choose the release for your PC.
The compressed file is in zst format.

Linux:
sudo apt install zstd
tar -I zstd -xvf <file>.pkg.tar.zst

Windows:
Unzip the file with peazip tool, that can be found at:
https://peazip.github.io/zstandard-compression-utility.html
Then, use again peazip to open the tar.
Make sure to add bin folder of ghdl in the user path

#5. Install GNAT (ADA compiler) tools on Linux/Windows

Since ghdl is developed in ADA language, we need to install GNAT tools.
Go to:
https://www.adacore.com/download

Linux:
Choose x86 GNU Linux (64 bits) gnat-2020-20200429-x86_64-linux-bin
Install it (for ex. under /opt)
sudo chmod +x gnat-2020-20200429-x86_64-linux-bin
./gnat-2020-20200429-x86_64-linux-bin

Add temporary GNAT binaries to PATH because we need it in order to build ghdl
export PATH="$PATH:/opt/GNAT/2020/bin/"

Windows:
Choose x86 Windows (64 bits) gnat-2020-20200429-x86_64-windows-bin.exe
Make sure to add bin folder of GNAT in the user path


Tip 1: For Linux users only, if you prefer you can build ghdl from scratch:

- Clone ghdl git repo
git clone https://github.com/ghdl/ghdl.git

- Build ghdl (before install switch to su to avoid errors)
cd ghdl/
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/
make
sudo su
make install

- Check ghdl binary
ls /usr/local/bin/
